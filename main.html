			<p><strong>Cyber Security Using Machine Learning to detect Malicious URLs</strong></p>
			<p>With the growth of Machine Learning in the past few years, many tasks are being done with the help of machine learning algorithms. Unfortunately, there has been little work done on machine learning and cybersecurity. We used the machine learning algorithm Logistic Regression. This type of statistical model (also known as logit model) is used for classification and predictive analytics.</p>
